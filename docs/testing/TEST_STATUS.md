# TEST STATUS — Automated & Manual

Live status of automated test suite health and manual verification, by phase. Append a new section per phase; do not delete history.

Status values: `NOT RUN` · `PASS` · `FAIL` · `BLOCKED` — see `TEST_PLAN.md`.

---

## Phase 0 — Project Definition & Development Governance

| Check | Type | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Documentation internal consistency review | Manual | PASS | Cross-references between CLAUDE.md, ROADMAP.md, CURRENT_STATE.md, DECISIONS.md checked for consistency during authoring. |
| No premature application code introduced | Manual | PASS | Confirmed only documentation/governance files were created; no `backend/`, `mobile/`, migrations, or endpoints exist. |

No automated tests apply to this phase — no application code exists yet.

## Phase 1 — Project Bootstrap

| Check | Type | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `composer validate --strict` (apps/api) | Automated | PASS | composer.json integrity |
| `vendor/bin/pint --test` (apps/api) | Automated | PASS | code style |
| `php artisan test` (apps/api) | Automated | PASS | 2 tests, 2 assertions — Laravel's own baseline example tests |
| `dart format --set-exit-if-changed .` (apps/mobile) | Automated | PASS | formatting |
| `flutter analyze` (apps/mobile) | Automated | PASS | no issues found |
| `flutter test` (apps/mobile) | Automated | PASS | 1 test — bootstrap shell smoke test |
| Laravel boots (`php artisan --version`, `migrate:status`) | Manual | PASS | Laravel 13.31.0; framework-default migrations ran cleanly |
| No secrets committed | Manual | PASS | `.env` and other secret-bearing files confirmed git-ignored via `git check-ignore`; only `.env.example` committed |
| No business functionality introduced | Manual | PASS | Confirmed by reviewing the full staged diff before commit |

## Phase 2 — Development Environment & CI

| Check | Type | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `composer validate --strict` (apps/api) | Automated, local | PASS | composer.json integrity, re-verified after Larastan added |
| `vendor/bin/pint --test` (apps/api) | Automated, local | PASS | code style, unaffected by Phase 2 changes |
| `php artisan test` (apps/api) | Automated, local | PASS | 2 tests, 2 assertions, unaffected |
| `vendor/bin/phpstan analyse` (apps/api) | Automated, local | BLOCKED (local only) | Could not install `phpstan/phpstan` locally in this session (sandboxed GitHub API access) — see `docs/handoffs/V1_PHASE_02_HANDOFF.md` §15/16. **Confirmed PASS via GitHub Actions** (see below): "[OK] No errors", 3 files analyzed. |
| `dart format --set-exit-if-changed .` (apps/mobile) | Automated, local | PASS | unaffected |
| `flutter analyze` (apps/mobile) | Automated, local | PASS | unaffected |
| `flutter test` (apps/mobile) | Automated, local | PASS | unaffected |
| Backend CI workflow (`.github/workflows/backend-ci.yml`) | Automated, GitHub Actions | PASS | Run [34367259866](https://github.com/jaaan44/company-app/actions/runs/34367259866), commit `fb4c548`, ~20s. All steps green including PHPStan. |
| Mobile CI workflow (`.github/workflows/mobile-ci.yml`) | Automated, GitHub Actions | PASS | Run [34367259884](https://github.com/jaaan44/company-app/actions/runs/34367259884), commit `fb4c548`, ~91s. |
| No real secrets in CI config | Manual | PASS | Workflows generate an ephemeral `APP_KEY` via `php artisan key:generate` after copying `.env.example`; no credentials committed or referenced |
| No business functionality introduced | Manual | PASS | Confirmed by reviewing the full staged diff before commit |
